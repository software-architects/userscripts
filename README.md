userscripts
===========
Scripts for use with [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/), [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) and possibly [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/user-scripts) to enhance the browsing experience.

Some scripts are related to [time cockpit](http://www.timecockpit.com) and improve the results of its application-based time tracking (e.g. for tracking Zendesk activity/working time).
